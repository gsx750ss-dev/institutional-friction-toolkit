## Activation Condition

This document is intentionally inactive by default.

It is intended to be populated, referenced, or activated only under
one or more of the following conditions:

- A publicly acknowledged AI-related incident has occurred, or
- Institutional, regulatory, or review bodies explicitly request
  post-incident stabilization references.

If none of these conditions are met, this document remains intentionally dormant.

No individual maintainer is expected to actively operate, update,
or curate this document outside the conditions stated above.

# Post-Incident Institutional Stabilization

This document is intentionally left minimal at creation time.

Content will be added in a subsequent step.

# Post-Incident Institutional Stabilization (Reference)

## Purpose
This document provides a neutral reference for institutional stabilization
after incidents involving recursive or autonomous AI systems.

It does not propose policies, mandates actions, or assign responsibility.

## Scope
- Reference-only material
- No enforcement or recommendations
- No attribution of fault or intent

## Typical Immediate Failures Observed
- Acceleration of competitive deployment
- Informal precedent formation without review
- Responsibility diffusion across organizations
- Review processes bypassed under urgency

## Reference-Only Options Commonly Considered
- Temporary suspension of review-based approvals
- Clarification of decision and responsibility boundaries
- Cross-organizational information sharing
- Preservation of audit and review records

## Notes
Use of this material does not constitute precedent
for approval, deployment, or policy adoption.
