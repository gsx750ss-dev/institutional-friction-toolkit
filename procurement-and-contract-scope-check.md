# Procurement and Contract Scope Check (Reference)

This document does not propose regulatory requirements,
mandatory clauses, or contractual obligations.

It provides descriptive reference questions
that may be considered during procurement,
vendor selection, SaaS adoption, API integration,
or outsourcing decisions involving autonomous systems.

---

When reviewing procurement or contractual adoption, consider:

- Does the contract explicitly preserve human override authority?
- Is decision accountability clearly attributable to a named entity?
- Are responsibility boundaries defined between vendor and operator?
- Does the agreement allow unilateral autonomy expansion without review?
- Are update mechanisms capable of materially altering system behavior?
- Is reliance increasing without corresponding oversight adaptation?

---

This checklist is descriptive and non-prescriptive.
It is intended only to clarify responsibility continuity
within procurement and contractual processes.
