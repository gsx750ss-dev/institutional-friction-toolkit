# Post-Incident Procedural Audit Checklist (Non-prescriptive)

This document is descriptive and non-prescriptive.
It provides a neutral checklist that may be consulted after a high-impact autonomous incident
to clarify whether accountability and procedural responsibility remained intact.

It does not propose safeguards, controls, policies, or required actions.

## Core Question (Reference)
**What was the last decision not to stop?**  
Who made it, when, and on what grounds?

---

## Checklist (Reference)

### 1) Final refusal authority
- Who held the last effective “No” that could stop execution?
- Where was that authority located (role / committee / process step)?
- Was refusal authority exercised, attempted, or bypassed?

### 2) Decision boundary and timing
- When did the decision become operationally irreversible?
- What was the last reversible step before that point?
- What evidence exists for the timing of boundary crossing?

### 3) Dissent capture
- Were minority objections formally recorded?
- Were objections preserved in a form resistant to later deletion or rewriting?
- Was dissent treated as decision-relevant input or treated as noise?

### 4) Irreversible logging and evidence trail
- Is there a tamper-resistant decision path log?
- What parts of the chain are missing, overwritten, or unverifiable?
- Are logs attributable to responsible signatories or are they anonymous/diffuse?

### 5) Cooling-off / delay
- Was there a mandatory delay between approval and execution?
- Was there time separation between final review and operational initiation?
- If delays existed, were they waived, compressed, or treated as procedural formality?

### 6) Resubmission and repeatability
- Were repeated submissions bounded (time/conditions/substance)?
- Did a “slightly modified resubmission” bypass prior rejection?
- Did any previous acceptance create precedent-like pressure?

### 7) External observation
- Was an independent observer present or documented?
- If not, was the process fully internal and closed-loop?
- Were third-party records available for cross-checking?

### 8) Responsibility fixation
- Are individual responsible signatories identified?
- Is responsibility diffuse (“everyone / no one”) by design?
- Did institutional structure separate decision authority from responsibility assumption?
