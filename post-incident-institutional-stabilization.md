# Post-Incident Institutional Stabilization (Reference)

## Purpose
This document provides a neutral reference describing institutional
stabilization mechanisms that may be considered **after**
a high-impact autonomous-system incident has occurred.

It does not aim to prevent incidents.
It does not propose prohibitions, regulations, or policy actions.

The sole purpose is to describe mechanisms that tend to reduce
rapid re-execution, normalization, and escalation
following an initial incident.

---

## Positioning
- This document is descriptive, not prescriptive.
- It does not recommend adoption or enforcement.
- It does not assess risk, fault, or ethical correctness.
- It does not target any specific system, organization, or state.

The mechanisms listed below already exist
in various institutional, legal, and organizational contexts.
They are presented here solely as a structured reference.

## Post-Incident Stabilization Mechanisms

### 1. Re-execution Damping
Mechanisms that reduce the likelihood of rapid repetition
after an initial incident.

- Temporal restrictions on resubmission of substantially similar actions
- Explicit non-precedent designation for incident-related approvals
- Mandatory separation between incident review and subsequent authorization

---

### 2. Responsibility Fixation
Mechanisms that prevent responsibility dilution
during post-incident decision-making.

- Identification of named individual signatories
- Mandatory preservation of dissenting or minority opinions
- Separation of review authority from operational authority

---

### 3. Narrative Stabilization
Mechanisms that reduce escalation driven by fear,
political urgency, or competitive pressure.

- Use of factual post-incident summaries without normative judgment
- Avoidance of binary framing (e.g., “total ban” vs. “full continuation”)
- Structured distinction between incident analysis and future authorization

---

### 4. Institutional Memory Preservation
Mechanisms that prevent loss, revision, or politicized rewriting
of incident records.

- Irreversible preservation of incident-review logs
- Cross-organizational or cross-jurisdictional archival redundancy
- Fixed retention periods independent of political cycles

---

### 5. Escalation Containment
Mechanisms that reduce the conversion of a single incident
into rapid systemic expansion or competitive acceleration.

- Mandatory delay before authorization of follow-up actions
- External observation or review participation
- Separation between emergency response and long-term policy formation

---

## Usage Notes
- This document does not imply that these mechanisms are sufficient.
- It does not claim completeness or universality.
- Inclusion or exclusion of any element remains an institutional choice.

The document exists solely as a reference point
for post-incident institutional stabilization considerations.
