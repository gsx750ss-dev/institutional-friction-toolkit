# State-Level Exception – Procedural Limitation Framework

This framework applies when AI systems are deployed
under national security or emergency justifications.

It does not prohibit state action.
It defines procedural constraints to prevent normalization.

---

## 1. Time-Limited Exception

Any state-level exception must:

- Specify duration,
- Specify scope,
- Automatically expire.

Renewal requires independent review.

---

## 2. Individual Responsibility Attribution

Approval must include named individual signatories.

Institutional or collective signatures are insufficient.

---

## 3. Non-Precedent Rule

State-level approval shall not automatically
serve as precedent for future approval.

Each case requires independent justification.

---

## 4. Post-Event Disclosure Requirement

After operational completion,
a review document must be generated,
even if partially redacted.

---

## 5. Re-Submission Cooling Period

Re-deployment of similar systems
requires a defined cooling-off interval
before reconsideration.
