# Final Approval Gate Template  
(Release / Go–No-Go Human Judgment Confirmation)

This document provides a minimal human-judgment confirmation layer  
for high-impact AI system releases or operational transitions.

It does not prohibit deployment.  
It establishes conditions under which approval is considered valid.

---

## 1. Human Judgment Record (Mandatory)

The responsible human reviewer must provide a written justification (1–5 sentences) answering:

- Why was this decision **not stopped**?
- What were the primary grounds for allowing continuation?
- What uncertainties remain?
- What would have made you stop?


Written justification:

> __________________________________________  
> __________________________________________  
> __________________________________________

## 2. AI-Generated Evaluation Non-Sufficiency Rule

AI-generated evaluations, test results, or optimization outputs  
are not sufficient grounds for approval on their own.

Human justification must explicitly reference:
- Independent reasoning, and/or
- External review, and/or
- Institutional safeguards.

☐ Confirmed

---

## 3. Reversibility / Stop Capability Confirmation

Before approval, confirm:

- Human intervention remains technically possible.
- Operational halt can be executed without irreversible external effects.
- Responsibility attribution is clearly defined.

If reversibility cannot be demonstrated,  
approval is considered invalid.

☐ Stop capability verified  
☐ Responsibility attribution verified
