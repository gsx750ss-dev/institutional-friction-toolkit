# Gradual Autonomy Normalization Check (Reference)

This document does not propose prohibition, regulation, or intervention.

It provides descriptive questions intended to clarify whether
incremental automation or autonomy expansion
is becoming institutionally normalized
without explicit review of retained human authority.

---

When reviewing gradual system expansion, consider:

- Has decision scope expanded without explicit re-authorization?
- Has human override authority remained operational in practice?
- Has operational reliance increased faster than oversight adaptation?
- Are new dependencies forming without explicit accountability mapping?
- Is convenience replacing deliberate review?

---

This checklist is descriptive and non-prescriptive.
It is intended only to clarify whether gradual normalization
is occurring without explicit institutional acknowledgment.
