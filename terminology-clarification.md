# Terminology Clarification (Reference)

## Purpose
This document clarifies the usage and non-usage of key terms
that are commonly misunderstood in discussions involving
advanced autonomous systems.

It exists solely to reduce semantic confusion.
It does not introduce new concepts, requirements, or evaluations.

---

## Scope
This document applies only to terminology usage
within this repository.

It does not redefine legal, technical, ethical,
or policy terminology outside this context.

---

## Clarified Terms

### "Control"
In this repository, "control" does NOT mean:
- real-time command over system behavior
- guaranteed outcome enforcement
- technical dominance over internal decision processes

When used, "control" refers only to
institutional or procedural constraints
on authorization, deployment, or repetition.

---

### "Safety"
"Safety" is NOT used here to imply:
- risk elimination
- harm prevention guarantees
- compliance with any specific safety framework

When referenced, "safety" refers only to
post-hoc institutional handling
and stabilization after events.

---

### "Alignment"
"Alignment" does NOT mean:
- value alignment
- moral alignment
- objective-function alignment

The term is not used to describe
internal system properties,
but may appear only in descriptions of
external institutional consistency.

---

### "Autonomy"
"Autonomy" does NOT imply:
- agency
- intent
- moral responsibility

It is used descriptively
to indicate operational independence
from immediate human intervention.

---

### "Incident"
An "incident" refers strictly to:
- a high-impact operational outcome
- regardless of intent, fault, or legality

It does NOT imply:
- wrongdoing
- system failure
- ethical violation

---

### "Responsibility"
"Responsibility" refers only to
institutional attribution mechanisms.

It does NOT imply:
- moral blame

---

## Explicit Non-Goals
This document does NOT:
- define best practices
- recommend policy actions
- assess system desirability
- propose preventive measures

---

## Usage Note
This clarification exists to prevent
post-incident semantic escalation,
where ambiguous terminology
drives unnecessary conflict or acceleration.
