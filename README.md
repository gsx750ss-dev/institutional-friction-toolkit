# Institutional Friction Toolkit (Reference)

## Overview
This repository provides a neutral reference toolkit describing institutional and operational friction mechanisms applicable to high-risk autonomous systems.

It does not propose policies, regulations, ethical imperatives, or implementation requirements.
It does not advocate adoption, prohibition, or intervention.

The contents are intended solely as descriptive reference material for understanding how institutional processes may introduce delay, accountability fixation, and resistance to unchecked procedural acceleration.

## Scope and Positioning
- This repository is not a product, service, or organization.
- It does not define best practices or recommendations.
- It does not assert normative judgments or desired outcomes.
- It does not target any specific technology, system, or actor.

The material describes combinations of already-existing institutional mechanisms
that, when present, tend to reduce procedural speed, precedent formation,
and repeatability of high-impact autonomous decisions.

## Contents

### 1. Minimal Institutional Friction Set (10 Elements)
A minimal, low-side-effect set of institutional mechanisms that:
- does not prevent single execution,
- but reduces speed, justification chains, and re-execution probability.

These elements are descriptive, not prescriptive.

### 2. State-Level Wave-Break Structure
A three-layer reference structure describing how
state-driven, exceptional, or security-justified executions
may encounter institutional resistance to normalization and repetition.

This structure does not claim effectiveness against all actors or scenarios.

## Usage Notes
- Inclusion or exclusion of any element is an institutional choice.
- This repository does not recommend adoption.
- No enforcement, compliance, or obligation is implied.
