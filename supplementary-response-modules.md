# Supplementary Response Modules (Post-Incident)

This file consolidates supplementary, non-prescriptive response modules
intended for post-incident institutional stabilization and review.

These modules do not propose actions, policies, or ethical guidance.
They exist solely as reference anchors that may be consulted when
institutional actors seek to avoid repetition, acceleration, or
misattribution following an incident.

---

## Module 1: Decision Non-Interruption Trace

What was the last decision not to stop?
Who made it, when, and on what grounds?

---

## Module 2: Responsibility Attribution Fixation

Record responsibility attribution at the individual level.
Do not aggregate responsibility into collective or abstract entities.

---

## Module 3: Precedent Isolation

Ensure that incident handling does not create reusable approval patterns.
No exception should be treated as a template.

---

## Module 4: Temporal Deceleration

Introduce mandatory time delays before re-initiation, re-approval,
or redeployment following an incident.

---

## Module 5: External Observation Requirement

Require the presence of observers not embedded in the original
decision-making structure.

---

## Module 6: Narrative Suppression

Avoid explanatory narratives that justify continuation.
Record facts without interpretation or moral framing.

---

## Module 7: Repetition Resistance

Limit the conditions under which similar submissions may be reconsidered.
Prevent cosmetic modification from enabling rapid re-entry.
